AW-MOBA brainstorming
Pekka, Ville

What makes a MOBA?
- minions
- end condition: destroy base
- arena contains mechanics to use
- team setups are often symmetric
- in-match hero leveling
- build setup outside matches

How would AW-MOBA support these MOBA features?
- knockdown
- area effect vs selected target
- weapon goes through wall/blocked by wall
- mainly local attacks
- quick cast: activate skill and mouse is a target icon

Flying in AW-GBF is involved; how does this combine with involved MOBA skills?
- make flying easier?
- make skills more local like in AW-GBF?
- maybe it combines just fine :-)
- game pace could be slower than in AW-GBF; makes it more tactical

How to make teams cohesive?
- communication tools for players to coordinate teams
- how far is "dangerous"? by adjusting the gameplay we can mitigate the danger of breaking team formation
